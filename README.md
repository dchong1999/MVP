# Shopify Live Queue

## Project Description

### Problem
A TikTok streamer who sells and fulfills orders during live-steams was unable to show customers how many orders had already been placed or what place in line a customer would be.

### Solution
This web application is a minimum viable solution created for a third party customer. Its purpose is to generate a live-queue of customers during livestreams by intervally making requests to the Shopify API to pull the customer information from newly placed orders and rendering that information to the screen. This way, the audience can see how many orders have been placed and what the expected wait time may be.

## Technologies
React.js, Express.js, Javascript, MongoDB, CSS, HTML, ShopifyAPI, Axios

## Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. Create an .env file with paramaters for the ShopifyAPI
3. Run 'npm run build' to create the webpack bundle
4. Run 'npm run server' to run the application
